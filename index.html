    			<p>There are two forms of astrology used today.<br><br>Tropical astrology is more commonly used in the West and online. It's what most are familiar with when reading about or referring to their respective zodiac signs. This zodiac system is about 2,000 years old and uses the seasons of the Earth.<br><br>Sidereal astrology isn't as commonly known or referred to. This hidden zodiac system dates back to at least 10,000 years in India and is much older as it uses the visible sky. Both systems are accurate for their own purposes but this system is thought to be more accurate for the language of the stars. It's said to describe the 'essence' of the personality and the soul!<br><br>Rediscover your zodiac sign and see if it aligns more with your true self.</p>

    				<h1>ARIES: THE RAM (APR 21 — MAY 12)</h1>
    				<p>As the first sign in the zodiac, the presence of Aries always marks the beginning of something energetic and turbulent. They're continuously looking for dynamic, speed and competition; always being the first in everything—from work to social gatherings. Thanks to thier ruling planet Mars and the fact it belongs to the element of Fire, Aries is one of the most active zodiac signs. It’s in their nature to take action, sometimes before they think about it.<br><br></p>
					
					<h1>MENTAL AGE: 1-7 YEARS</h1>

    				<h1>ELEMENT: CARDINAL FIRE</h1>
    				<p>Embodying the element of cardinal fire, Aries are the ones who break ground on new ideas. They're also the ones wanting action and getting everyone into action like a team captain.

    				<h1>COLOUR(S): RED</h1>
    				<p>The energizing color red initiates the excitement and assertion that supports Aries' and their active nature and eagerness for life.<br><br></p>

    				<h1>OPHIUCHUS: THE SNAKE BEARER (DEC 7—DEC 18)</h1>
    				<p>Starting with a resurfaced story about how NASA 'discovered' a 13th zodiac sign, many were confused and quite devastated. In fact, Ophiuchus isn't a new discover and has always been a constellation lying between the borders of Scorpio and Sagittarius. The current tropical astrological system was developed by the Babylonians and adapted by the Greeks who sought to divide the sky into 12 sections, 1 for each of the 12 months or moon cycles in the year. They then chose 12 constellations, one in each of those sections. And as the year progresses and the Earth rotates around the sun, the sun appears to pass through each of the 12 sections and 12 constellations. The Babylonians actually recognized 13 important constellions—the 12 we're familiar with, plus Ophiuchus. However, they decided to leave Ophichus out as it was never a formal astrological sign.<br><br></p>
					
					<h1>THE 13TH ASTROLOGICAL SIGN</h1>
					<p>In Sidereal astrology, Ophiuchus has sometimes been suggested as the 13th astrological sign in addition to the 12 that we're already familiar with. As its constellation consists of 2 part (Ophiuchus and Serpens), and is positioned between the borders of both Scorpio and Sagittarious; those born under this sign are said to have an entangles character, or mixed traits from Scorpios and Sagittairus. But no matter what they're like, they can't deny the traits of the other half. These Ophiuchus individuals are known to be the charmers of the zodiac; are very insightful and knowledgeable; as well as magnetic and captivating. Scorpio's character and temperament dominate the Ophiuchus people, so they're calm, thinking, agression and attentive. At the same time, they're similar to Sagittarius'and their passion, insight and continuing efforsts to achieve a goal. In summary, Ophiuchus poeple are very complicated and changeable despite thier good intentions.</p>

    				<h1>AQUARIUS: THE WATER BEARER (FEB 14 — MAR 9)</h1>
    				<p>Aquarians are different from the rest of the other zodiac signs as they have the ability to see without prejudice. This makes them eccentric and energetic in their fight for freedom, or at times shy and quiet, afraid to express their true personality. In both cases they're deep thinkers and high intellectuals who love to fight for idealistic causes. Although they can easily adapt to the energy that surrounds them, some have a deep need for time alone and away from everything in order to restore power.<br><br></p>
					
					<h1>MENTAL AGE: 70-77 YEARS</h1>
					<p>Aquarians are all about social consciousness and humanitarianism. They've reached at an older age where some childlike behaviors start comign back, but they're still logical and intelligent. Their motives to stay on path to reach their destination and differing childlike attitude is a breath of fresh air during stressful situations.<br><br></p>
